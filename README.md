# Employee of the month
## What is it?
This app was created as part of the last coding assignment in my first year at studying Software Development at NOVI Hogeschool (The Netherlands).  
It is also the first-ever Android app I wrote.
## What does it do?
It's kind of a poor man's Snapchat clone, meaning you can take pictures (of someone) with it, overlay funny stuff (such as hats, ears, beards and the like) and share the result with your friends (or the rest of the world).
## Files and permissions
The app used its own application folder to store .jpg files. It only needs permission for the camera.
## Source material
The app uses (modified versions of) code from the following GitHub projects (thanks!):  
- [Camera2Basic](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-Camera2Basic)  
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)  
- [MotionViews-Android](https://github.com/uptechteam/MotionViews-Android)  
- [Android Gesture Detectors](https://github.com/Almeros/android-gesture-detectors)  
  
I hope you have as much fun with it as I did.
